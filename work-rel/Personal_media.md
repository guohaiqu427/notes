## CSS Attribute Selector

	- Selector: .main [data-module-template="hero"]

## the prefix:

1. ***experimental*** or ***nonstandard*** CSS properties and JavaScript APIs
2. ***prevent*** from ***breaking*** web developers' code

> Browser vendors sometimes add prefixes to experimental or nonstandard CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so developers can experiment with new ideas while—in theory—preventing their experiments from being relied upon and then breaking web developers' code during the standardization process.
